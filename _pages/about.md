Hi there!

I'm Kosta, a Ph.D. student in Psychology at the University of California, San Diego. I work with David Barner in the [Language and Development Lab](https://ladlab.ucsd.edu). I am interested in understanding the human capacity for abstract thought. I take a developmental approach, asking how children develop language and abstract concepts.

Previously, I completed my B.S. in Cognitive Science at the University of Connecticut, where I worked with Umay Suanda in the [Communication and Development Lab](https://comdev.uconn.edu). When I am not thinking about thinking, I enjoy running, traveling the world, and cheering on the New England Patriots.
